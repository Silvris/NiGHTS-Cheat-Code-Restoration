# NiGHTS-Cheat-Code-Restoration
Restores the inaccessible cheat codes in the Steam port of NiGHTS into Dreams...

The PS2 release of *NiGHTS into Dreams...* features a set of cheat codes to access otherwise time-gated costumes, as well as a single-session all unlock cheat.
These 5 cheat codes made their way into later releases of the game on the PS3, Xbox 360, and Steam. However, the Steam version had a small addition in that pressing
Cross/A on the title screen acts the same as Start, locking out 2 of the 5 cheat codes, as they are reliant on the A button. This dll changes the inputs required for
these two cheats, so they can be accessed.

| Cheat Code | Original Input | New Input |
| -----------| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Access all unlockables | Left, Right, Square/X, Cross/A, Circle/B, Triangle/Y, R1/RB, R2/RT, Down, Up, L1/LB, L2/LT | Left, Right, Square/X, Triangle/Y, Circle/B, Triangle/Y, R1/RB, R2/RT, Down, Up, L1/LB, L2/LT |
| Access Claris's Summer and Halloween Costumes | Left, Down, Right, Cross/A, L1/LB, L2/LT, Select | Left, Down, Right, Square/X, L1/LB, L2/LT, Select |

And the ones already present within the game:

| Cheat Code | Input |
| -----------| --------------------------- |
| Access Elliot's Summer and Halloween Costumes | Left, Up, Right, Circle/B, R1/RB, R2/RT, Select |
| Access NiGHTS's Reala costume in Spring Valley | Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Circle/B, Square/X, Circle/B, Square/X |
